# dropout

A utility type that allows you to defer dropping your data to a background thread.
Inspired by [this article](https://abramov.io/rust-dropping-things-in-another-thread) by Aaron Abramov and [defer-drop crate](https://github.com/Lucretiel/defer-drop)

## Simple example

```rust
// See examples/demo.rs


type HeavyObject = HashMap<usize, Vec<usize>>;

fn make_heavy_object() -> HeavyObject {
    (1..=NUM_ELEMENTS).map(|v| (v, vec![v])).collect()
}

println!("Allocating a heavy object");
let first_heavy_object = make_heavy_object();

println!("Duplicating that vector");
let second_heavy_object = first_heavy_object.clone();

// Create a dropper, dropping `Vec<Vec<String>>`.
let dropper = dropout::new_dropper();

// This is a special case for this small test.
// The closure will explictly drop vec1 but also implicitly drop the `dropper`
// and we don't want that as, at drop, dropper wait for background thread.
// We don't want to mesure that.
let dropper_clone = dropper.clone();
let dropout_timer = timer(move || dropper_clone.dropout(first_heavy_object));
let std_timer = timer(move || drop(second_heavy_object));

println!("Duration of dropout: {:?}", dropout_timer);
println!("Duration of std drop: {:?}", std_timer);
```

Output is (can be):

```
Allocating a heavy object
Duplicating that vector
Dropping the vectors
Duration of dropout: 7.479Âµs
Duration of std drop: 50.864814ms
```

## Difference with defer-drop

Defer-drop use one global background thread to drop any object type.
- All object are send to the background thread through a Box
- This is made automatically by wrapping the object into a `DeferDrop` which will
  send the object to drop thread when wrapper is drop.

This is nice as you don't need to manage any thing else than your `DeferDrop` which deref to `T`.
But is may be complex when you have to pass you object to a library expected a `T` or `impl Trait`.

Dropout take the opposite idea:
- You create a Dropper which accept (and take ownership) of a `T`.
- You handle `T` object and explicitly defer the drop at end.

Licensing differences:
- defer-drop is licensed under MPL-2.0
- dropout is licensed under MIT


```rust
// In external library

pub trait MyTrait {
  fn get_u32(&self) -> u32;
}

fn do_stuff_with_object<T: MyTrait>(object: T) {
  ...
  drop(object)
}

// In user library
use external_library::{MyTrait, do_stuff_with_object};

struct MyObject {}
impl MyTrait for MyObject {
  fn get_u32(self) -> u32 {
    5
  }
};

struct DeferedMyObject(DeferedDrop<MyObject>)

impl MyTrait for DeferedMyObject {
  fn get_u32(&self) -> u32 {
    self.0.get_u32()
  }
}

fn main() {
  do_stuff_with_object(MyObject{}); // Works
  do_stuff_with_object(DeferDrop::new(MyObject{})); // Doesn't work as DeferDrop doesn't impl MyTrait
  do_stuff_with_object(DeferedMyObject(DeferDrop::new(MyObject{}))); // Works
}
```

And this is almost impossible if trait consume self as `Box<Self>`

```rust
pub trait MyTrait {
  fn get_as_u32(self: Box<Self>) -> u32;
}

fn do_stuff_with_u32(object: Box<dyn MyTrait>) {
  let value = object.get_as_u32();
  ...
}
```

## Notes

Carefully consider whether this pattern is necessary for your use case.
Like all worker-thread abstractions, sending the value to a separate thread comes with its own costs, so it should
only be done if performance profiling indicates that it's a performance gain.

Dropped values are enqueued in an unbounded channel to be consumed by dropping thread; if you produce more garbage
than the thread can handle, this will cause unbounded memory consumption.
There is currently no way for the thread to signal or block if it is overwhelmed.

All of the standard non-determinism threading caveats apply here.
The objects are guaranteed to be destructed in the order received through a channel, which means that objects sent from a single thread will be destructed in order.
However, there is no guarantee about the ordering of interleaved values from different threads.

Additionally, there are no guarantees about how long the values will be queued before being dropped.
However, when the dropper is droped, it waits for the background thread to finish, so this is guarented that all objects will be droped at some point.
